			<h2>Cyclists’ Training Camp</h2>
			
			<p>
				Run by
				<a href="https://perfectcondition.co.uk/about-me/"><strong>Tim Williams</strong></a>, the camp is open
				to all members of the Cambridge cycling and triathlon clubs (except unaccompanied minors) and is
				particularly targeted at the people in the clubs who train regularly together on the weekly rides in
				Cambridge.
			</p>
			
			<h2>When: April 20th to April 28th 2024</h2>
			
			<p>
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
				Most years the camp takes place just after the clocks change at the end of March. This is the ideal
				balance of pre-season, long evenings and, hopefully, holiday weather. It’s also normally just before
				the schools break up for Easter and the real holiday season starts.
				In 2024, however, Easter is early and falls right in our regular slot. Having considered shifting the
				camp forward to mid-March I feel that the consensus from most of those who came last year was to
				shift backward to late April in the hope of ensuring even more holiday-like weather.
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
			</p>
			
			<h2>What</h2>
			
			<p>
				The camp is based on a structured programme of group rides, and includes ad-hoc group and
				individual coaching sessions and discussions*. The groups are along the lines of those we regularly
				ride in:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="my-2">
					<strong>Sporting Plus:</strong> &nbsp; Fast chaingang, BCF license holders. The programme includes
                    long rides, fast group rides, chain gangs, and lead out and tactical practise. Time trial.
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					<strong>Sporting:</strong> &nbsp; Tri-club chaingang. Long mountain rides, technical descending, fast
					group rides. Time trial.
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					<strong>Intermediate Plus:</strong> &nbsp; Tri-club medium chaingang. For those who want to want
					to do all or most of the above, over the best roads and scenery, but feel that they would
					enjoy themselves better not having to keep up with the faster groups.
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					<strong>Intermediate:</strong> &nbsp; What’s the rush? Happy to ride steadily all day
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Tim structures the camp to try and ensure that you get the most out of your time without being too
				tired to enjoy it. He knows pretty much every road on the island so you are guaranteed to get the
				best riding that Mallorca has to offer (and that’s pretty much as good it gets anywhere).
			</p>
			
			<h2>Accomodation</h2>
			
			<p>
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
				We will be staying at the Pabisa Sofia. This is a change from the camp as originally announced. The
				location is essentially the same (250m away). The hotel is part of the same group and is similar to
				the main building of the Bali hotel that we used in 2022 and 2023. Unlike the Bali It doesn’t have a
				new block with suites, so these are no longer available
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The programme of the camp will be cycling based, however Arenal is a good base for triathlon as
				there is an indoor swimming pool close to the hotel and the sea is roughly one minute away. The
				promenade is largely traffic free for running and there are some trails within easy running distance.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Cost</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="my-2">
					Single occupancy standard room - <strong>£780</strong> (initial payment £580)
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					Double occupancy standard room - <strong>£610</strong> (initial payment £410) per person
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					Willing to share a twin room - <strong>£690</strong> (initial payment £560)
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					Single occupancy sea-view room - <strong>£890</strong> (initial payment £690)
				</li>
				<li class="my-2">
					Double occupancy sea-view room - <strong>£690</strong> (initial payment £490) per person
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				<strong style="color: red;">You will have to book your own flights to Palma.</strong>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Payment and Deposit</h2>
			
			<p>
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
				The hotel prices are fixed in Euro. I think that it makes sense to buy Euro as early as possible to
				guarantee that we don’t end up paying more.
			</p>
			<p>
				To minimise the risk of losing out I therefore require an initial payment with your booking which I
				will convert to Euro and use to pay a deposit to the hotel The remainder is payable one month
				before traveling (i.e. by the end of February).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you cancel more than one month before travelling I will return 75% of your deposit.
			</p>
			<p>
				The prices are based on €1 ~ 90p. If the exchange rate fluctuates significantly from that I reserve the
				right to adjust the price for people who have not yet paid a deposit.
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Travel Dates and Transfers</h2>
			
			<p>
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
				We will collect you at Palma Airport on 20th and return you to Palma Airport on 28th. If you travel
				on any other dates you will have to organise your own transfers. I will, however, adjust your hotel
				reservation for the nights that you will be staying and your bill accordingly.
				<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Covid</h2>
			
			<p>
				We will be subject to whatever Covid regulations are in place at the time of travel.
			</p>
