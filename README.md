# ELSR-Website
Website for my local cycling group: EL Social Rides.

This is my first attempt at building a real website using Python / Flask / Bootstrap / SQLAlchemy. 

It was written primarily as a learning experience for myself.

However, it will go live and serve as a website for my current cycling  group.

Currently live at https://www.elsr.co.uk/

The website has a database of cafes which the group cycle to and also GPX files of routes to the cafes.
The USP of the site is that the backend analyses the GPX files and then links them to cafes which are close
to the route.
